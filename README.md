# Project Capture the Castle (paper, rock, scissors) 

This was a challenge project from The Odin Project, where the goal was to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. I decided to take the idea and adapt it into a Capture the Castle game, which follows the same logic but with a theme centered around conquering an enemy castle.
